          <h3>
            Kids these days are spending too much time on their screens playing
            video games(especially now). To keep their brain from getting
            spoiled, you need to give your child problems to solve. Coding can
            help with this because it can boost your child's creative thinking
            skills. As a result, they will be able to solve harder problems
            faster.

          <h3>
            Coding also helps with improving your logical skills. Coding makes
            you think about coding problems in a very abstract way and you may
            even discover new ways to solve the problems. Your kids will apply
            these logical thinking skills in their school and other places.

            Many people don't make their kids learn coding because they assume
            that coding is hard. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! With proper help and a
            fun experience, kids can pick up coding in no time. With this skill,
            they can solve problems and change the world for the better.
